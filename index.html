            <p id="bio">Nimrath is a second-year Computer Science major from New Jersey who is passionate about using technology to create educational opportunities for underrepresented communities. In high school, she co-founded a coding bootcamp for middle schoolers through WheelsForAll and started her school's GirlsWhoCode chapter, growing it from 5 to 35 members. At Georgia Tech, she continues building impactful technology through projects like TrashAI (an app that helps students recycle correctly) while serving as a CS 1331 TA to help fellow students overcome programming challenges. She's excited to join Bits of Good to help nonprofits leverage technology in ways that amplify their community impact.</p>
